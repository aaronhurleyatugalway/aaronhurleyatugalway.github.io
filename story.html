                Once upon a time, there was a blue squishy yeti squishmallow. He decided to eat potatoes, and
                look for crystals in supermarkets. He would bark like a dog if he saw a blue crystal, and
                meow like a rabbit if he saw a purple one.

                not knowing the capital of Kazakhstan. It was a truly ridiculous day, and the Gardai in Cork had to
                lock him up. The next day, he ate a pizza.
