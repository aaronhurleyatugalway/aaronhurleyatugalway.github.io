			<h1>History of the World Wide Web</h1>
			<h2>Precursors</h2>
			<p>The hypertext portion of the Web in particular has an intricate intellectual history; notable influences and precursors
			include Vannevar Bush's Memex, IBM's Generalized Markup Language, and Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu. </p>
			<p>Paul Otlet's Mundaneum project has also been named as an early 20th century precursor of the Web.</p>
			<p>The concept of a global information system connecting homes is prefigured in "A Logic Named Joe", a 1946 short
			story by Murray Leinster, in which computer terminals, called "logics," are present in every home. Although the computer
			system in the story is centralized, the story anticipates a ubiquitous information environment similar to the Web. The
			cultural impact of the web was imagined even further back in a short story by E. M. Forster, "The Machine Stops," first
			published in 1909.</p>
			<h2>1980-1991: Invention and implementation of the Web</h2>
			<p>The NeXTcube used by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN became the first Web server.
			In 1980, Tim Berners-Lee, an English independent contractor at the European Organization for Nuclear Research
			(CERN) in Switzerland, built ENQUIRE, as a personal database of people and software models, but also as a way to
			play with hypertext; each new page of information in ENQUIRE had to be linked to an existing page.</p>
			<p>Berners-Lee's contract in 1980 was from June to December, but in 1984 he returned to CERN in a permanent role,
			and considered its problems of information management: physicists from around the world needed to share data, yet
			they lacked common machines and any shared presentation software.</p>
			<p>Shortly after Berners-Lee's return to CERN, TCP/IP protocols were installed on some key non-Unix machines at the
			institution, turning it into the largest Internet site in Europe within a few years. As a result, CERN's infrastructure was
			ready for Berners-Lee to create the Web.</p>
			<p>Berners-Lee wrote a proposal in March 1989 for "a large hypertext database with typed links". Although the proposal
			attracted little interest, Berners-Lee was encouraged by his boss, Mike Sendall, to begin implementing his system on a
			newly acquired NeXT workstation.He considered several names, including Information Mesh,The Information Mine or
			Mine of Information, but settled on World Wide Web.</p>
			<p>Robert Cailliau, Jean-Francois Abramatic and Tim Berners-Lee at the 10th anniversary of the WWW Consortium.
			Berners-Lee found an enthusiastic supporter in Robert Cailliau. Berners-Lee and Cailliau pitched Berners-Lee's ideas to
			the European Conference on Hypertext Technology in September 1990, but found no vendors who could appreciate his
			vision of marrying hypertext with the Internet.</p>
			<p>By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web: the HyperText Transfer
			Protocol (HTTP) 0.9,[11] the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the first Web browser (named WorldWideWeb,
			which was also a Web editor), the first HTTP server software (later known as CERN httpd), the first web server
			(http://info.cern.ch), and the first Web pages that described the project itself. The browser could access Usenet
			newsgroups and FTP files as well. However, it could run only on the NeXT; Nicola Pellow therefore created a simple text
			browser, called the Line Mode Browser, that could run on almost any computer.[12] To encourage use within CERN,
			Bernd Pollermann put the CERN telephone directory on the web previously users had to log onto the mainframe in order
			to look up phone numbers.</p>
			<p>While inventing and working on setting up the Web, Berners-Lee spent most of his working hours in Building 31 at 
			Sample Assessment Exercises 4
			CERN, but also at his two homes, one in France, one in Switzerland.[13] In January 1991 the first Web servers outside
			CERN itself were switched on.</p>

			<h1>Tim Berners Lee: A Profile</h1>
			<p>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee OM KBE FRS FREng FRSA FBCS (born 8 June 1955),[1] also known as TimBL, is
			an English engineer and computer scientist, best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. He is currently a
			professor of computer science at the University of Oxford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[3][4]
			He made a proposal for an information management system in March 1989,[5] and he implemented the first successful
			communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the internet in mid-November the
			same year.</p>
			<p>Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development
			of the Web. He is also the founder of the World Wide Web Foundation and is a senior researcher and holder of the
			3Com founders chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).[11] He is a director
			of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI),[12] and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for
			Collective Intelligence.[13][14] In 2011, he was named as a member of the board of trustees of the Ford
			Foundation.[15] He is a founder and president of the Open Data Institute.</p>
			<p>In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work.[16][17] In April 2009, he was
			elected a foreign associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences.[18][19] Named in Time magazine's list
			of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century, Berners-Lee has received a number of other accolades for his
			invention.[20] He was honoured as the "Inventor of the World Wide Web" during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening
			ceremony, in which he appeared in person, working with a vintage NeXT Computer at the London Olympic
			Stadium.[21] He tweeted "This is for everyone",[22] which instantly was spelled out in LCD lights attached to the chairs
			of the 80,000 people in the audience.[21] Berners-Lee received the 2016 Turing Award "for inventing the World Wide
			Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale".</p>
			<h2>Early life and education</h2>
			<p>Berners-Lee was born in London, England, United Kingdom,[24] one of four children born to Mary Lee Woods and
			Conway Berners-Lee. His parents worked on the first commercially built computer, the Ferranti Mark 1. He attended
			Sheen Mount Primary School, and then went on to attend south west London's Emanuel School from 1969 to 1973, at
			the time a direct grant grammar school, which became an independent school in 1975.[1][16] A keen trainspotter as a
			child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.[25] He studied at The Queen's College, Oxford,
			from 1973 to 1976, where he received a first-class bachelor of arts degree in physics.[1][24] While he was at college,
			Berners-Lee made a computer out of an old television set, which he bought from a repair shop.</p>
			<p>After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in Poole,
			Dorset.[24] In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create type-setting software for
			printers.</p>
			<p>Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980. While in Geneva, he
			proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among
			researchers.[27] To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.</p>
			<p>After leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth,
			Dorset.[29] He ran the company's technical side for three years.[30] The project he worked on was a "real-time remote
			procedure call" which gave him experience in computer networking.[29] In 1984, he returned to CERN as a fellow.</p>
			<p>In 1989, CERN was the largest internet node in Europe, and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with
			the internet:</p>
			<p><i>I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the Transmission Control Protocol and domain name
			system ideas and "ta-da!" the World Wide Web... Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the
			situation without it was very difficult when I was working at CERN later. Most of the technology involved in the web, like
			the hypertext, like the internet, multifont text objects, had all been designed already. I just had to put them together. It
			was a step of generalising, going to a higher level of abstraction, thinking about all the documentation systems out 
			Sample Assessment Exercises 5
			there as being possibly part of a larger imaginary documentation system</i></p>
			<p>This NeXT Computer was used by Berners-Lee at CERN and became the world's first web server
			Berners-Lee wrote his proposal in March 1989 and, in 1990, redistributed it. It then was accepted by his manager,
			Mike Sendall, who called his proposals 'vague, but exciting'.[33] He used similar ideas to those underlying the
			ENQUIRE system to create the World Wide Web, for which he designed and built the first Web browser. His software
			also functioned as an editor (called WorldWideWeb, running on the NeXTSTEP operating system), and the first Web
			server, CERN HTTPd (short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol daemon).</p>
			<p>Mike Sendall buys a NeXT cube for evaluation, and gives it to Tim [Berners-Lee]. Tim's prototype implementation
			on NeXTStep is made in the space of a few months, thanks to the qualities of the NeXTStep software development
			system. This prototype offers WYSIWYG browsing/authoring! Current Web browsers used in 'surfing the internet' are
			mere passive windows, depriving the user of the possibility to contribute. During some sessions in the CERN cafeteria,
			Tim and I try to find a catching name for the system. I was determined that the name should not yet again be taken
			from Greek mythology..... Tim proposes 'World-Wide Web'. I like this very much, except that it is difficult to pronounce
			in French... by Robert Cailliau, 2 November 1995.</p>
